To use bino with NVIDIA Quadro SDI output, locate NVCtrl.h NVCtrlLib.h and
libXNVCtrl.a from the NVIDIA Quadro SDI SDK, and use the following configure
options:

$ ./configure --with-xnvctrl xnvctrl_CFLAGS="-I/sdk/include/path/" xnvctrl_LDFLAGS="-L/sdk/lib/path"
<<<<<<< HEAD
On Ubuntu, the required files can be found in the nvidia-settings package.


The configure command can become quite complex. For example: at the UTS Data Arena,
bino is built with equalizer (and a custom version of OpenAL).  Shell variables make
the subsequent configure command a little easier. Obviously change the dir names to
match your installation, and don't type the '$' which represents the shell prompt).


During this build, everything sat in a filesystem called /touro/dev
Hopefully this might help if you're building bino with Equalizer and OpenAL.
The qtchooser command is not necessary. It's just a check.

$ HERE=/touro/dev/bino
$ EQ=/touro/dev/equalizer/v1.10/install
$ OPENAL=/touro/dev/openal/63n/openal-soft/install
$ export QT_SELECT=5
$ qtchooser -print-env
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/touro/dev/equalizer/v1.10/install/lib

Then there is this multi-line configure command, split over many lines by back-slashes:

$   ./configure --prefix=${HERE}/install          \
  CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11                             \
  LDFLAGS="-L${EQ}/lib -L${OPENAL}/lib            \
  -lopenal -lXext -lEqualizer -lEqualizerFabric   \
  -lEqualizerServer -lDeflect -lLunchbox          \
  -lCollage -lPression -lServus -lhwsd"           \
  --with-equalizer                                \
  libEqualizer_CFLAGS=-I${EQ}/include             \
  libEqualizer_LIBS=-L${EQ}/lib                   \
  libopenal_CFLAGS=-I${OPENAL}/include/AL         \
  libopenal_LIBS=-L${OPENAL}/lib                  \


=======

On Debian, the required files can be found in the libxnvctrl-dev package.
