This is a random collection of small ideas and plans. It is not a priority list.

Please also see the "Help wanted" section on the Bino website:

Small:

- Make media_input more flexible so that files can be added during playback
  (e.g. subtitle files)?

Medium:

- Add deinterlacing support.

- Better interaction with output devices, e.g. by setting monitor/TV modes.
  Is this possible?

- Render subtitles into black bars instead of the video area (optionally)?

- Add playlist support.

- Add a "loop playback" option to support A->B loops (and playlist loops if
  there is a playlist).

Big:

- Rework media input and player interaction/controlling so that it is possible
  to support devices like DVDs (libdvdread) and BluRays (libbluray).

- Hardware accelerated video decoding.
