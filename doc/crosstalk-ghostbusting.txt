Many stereoscopic display devices suffer from crosstalk between the left and
right view. This results in ghosting artifacts that can degrade the viewing
quality, depending on the video content.

Bino can optionally reduce the ghosting artifacts. For this, it needs two know
1) the amount of crosstalk of your display device and
2) the amount of ghostbusting that is adequate for the video you want to
watch.

Please note that ghostbusting does not work with anaglyph glasses.

To measure the display crosstalk, do the following:

1. Display the gamma pattern image and correct the display gamma settings
   according to the included instructions. You need to have correct gamma
   settings before measuring crosstalk.
   $ bino -i mono gamma-pattern.png

2. Display the crosstalk pattern images and determine the crosstalk levels
   using the included instructions.
   $ bino crosstalk-pattern-l.png crosstalk-pattern-r.png

You now have three crosstalk values (for the red, green, and blue channels) or
alternatively one combined crosstalk value. You can now tell Bino about this
using the --crosstalk option. For example, if you have measured 8% of
crosstalk for red, 12% for green, and 10% for blue, use
$ bino --crosstalk 8,12,10

Once you know the crosstalk levels of your display device, you can set the
amount of ghostbusting that Bino should apply using the --ghostbust option. This
will vary depending on the content you want to watch. Movies with very dark
scenes should be viewed with at least 50% ghostbusting (--ghostbust 50), whereas
overall bright movies, where crosstalk is less disturbing, could be viewed with
a lower level (e.g. --ghostbust 10).
