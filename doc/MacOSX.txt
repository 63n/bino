                  Compiling with Equalizer on Mac OS X


Install (or upgrade) all dependency packages (ffmpeg glew qt4-mac
openal) from MacPorts using the universal variant:

# sudo port install (or upgrade --enforce-variants) <package> +universal


Since not all dependencies does exist in the universal variant, building
in 32 bit does not work out of the box. It might be possible to install
all dependencies manually. Tested is building in 64 bit using an
Equalizer version compiled for GLX (AGL does not support 64 bit).


Use the following configure options to select the proper frameworks and
architecture:

# ./configure --with-equalizer libEqualizer_CFLAGS="-I<EQ_DIR>/include" libEqualizer_LIBS="-L<EQ_DIR>/lib -lEqualizer" libopenal_LIBS="-L/opt/local/lib -framework OpenAL" libopenal_CFLAGS="-framework OpenAL" CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/X11R6/include"
